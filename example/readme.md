# ngx-monaco example

## Prerequisites

1. `npm@5.2.0` or greater (we need `npx`)


## Installation

Install the dependencies from both the library as well as from the example project.

```
$ npx yarn
$ cd example && npx yarn
```


## Start

Start the example from within the `example` directory by running

```
$ npx yarn start
```

This will build the library first, link it to the example project and start building the example application.
